This is the GitHub repo associated to a research project carried out by Th√©o BERTRAND, Bastien LAVILLE, Laure BLANC-FERAUD and Gilles AUBERT.

In this work we aim to adapt a recent Inverse Problem model of Curve Recovery by changing the setting to the Position-Orientation space and proposing new ways to discretize the space of curves.



# Data and output
Here is an example of the kind of pile of images we have access to :

The script  unraveled_frank_wolfe_3_spikes.py performs a simple frank wolfe in the case of finding 2 or 3 curves according to the ground truth shown in our work.

Here is an example of such a reconstruction  with Piecewise Geodesic curves in the Riemannian Reeds-Shepp model :
