This is the GitHub repo associated to a research project carried out by Th√©o BERTRAND, Bastien LAVILLE, Laure BLANC-FERAUD and Gilles AUBERT.

In this work we aim to adapt a recent Inverse Problem model of Curve Recovery by changing the setting to the Position-Orientation space and proposing new ways to discretize the space of curves.
